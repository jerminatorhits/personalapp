<h2>Software Engineering</h2>

<p>If you asked me upon graduating college that I'd be a software engineer, I wouldn't have believed you. After experiencing the post-college world, I found software engineering a more practical way to fuel my creative aspirations. As a mechanical engineering graduate, I implemented C/C++, MATLAB, and LabView in several school projects but programming never really appealed to me mainly because it is difficult to grasp what's actually happening within the computer, especially in embedded, black-box software. After college, I started learning music production which required downloading workstations, various plugins, sample packs, and understanding I/O signals. Understanding software would help me produce higher quality music. As a result, I started learning a little bit of everything from HTML/CSS to MySQL. The truth is, you start with what you know; everyone encounters bugs. The process is greatly rewarding in the end. Click on the link below to visit my projects:
